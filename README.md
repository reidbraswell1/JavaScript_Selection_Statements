# JavaScript_Selection_Statements

## Exercise 1

1. Initialize an integer to represent a favorite number and assign a value with a number of your choosing or you can assign a random number to this variable.<br>
2. Use `window.prompt()` to ask the user to input a number, and store the result in a variable<br>
3. Create an if-statement that if the guessed number is below the initial value, print out “too low”.<br>
4. Create an else-if statement that if the number is higher than the initial value, print out “too high”.<br>
5. Create an else statement that prints out “Congratulations!!!”.<br>

## Exercise 2

1. Declare a variable named userInput2 (or whatever topic you’ll ask about) and set the value to `window.prompt(“Whatever question you want to ask here”)`.<br>
2. Inside of the parentheses, ask a question on whatever (appropriate) topic you’d like.<br>
3. Create a switch-case statement with 5+ cases and a default case.<br>
4. Log a response to the console depending on the value of userInput2.<br>
